Welcome to my DS3: Datathon repository! This repository contains all the [code and notebooks](https://github.com/bew030/ds3-lyft-datathon/tree/master/notebooks) that my team and written along with the [report](https://github.com/bew030/ds3-lyft-datathon/blob/master/writings/Lyft%20Paper.pdf) that we had submitted which had won the Datathon. This was my first datathon that I had participated in and it was a very rewarding experience and I look forward to participating in many other datathons in the future! 

Special thanks to the Data Science Student Society and all the sponsors for making this opportunity possible!

# Overview 

The Datathon provided us with 3 different datasets: one on Google Local Reviews, one on animal image classification, and one on traffic collisions in San Diego. The Datathon was very open ended, but the goal was to pick one dataset, perform an analysis, and extract insights (such as data visualization, hypothesis testing, classification models, etc.).

Our team decided to work with the traffic datasets, which included information on vehicle crashes and traffic levels that took place in San Diego. Our procedure included understanding and cleaning the datasets, brainstorming some questions that the data might answer, and utilizing visuals and statistics to help answer these questions and form a conclusion.

More information about the traffic dataset used can be found [here](https://github.com/data-science-student-society/datathon2019/tree/master/datasets/traffic). If you have any extra questions feel free to reach out by email or leave an issue.
